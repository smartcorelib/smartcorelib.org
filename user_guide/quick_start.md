# Getting Started

Welcome to *SmartCore*, the most advanced machine learning library in Rust! In *SmartCore* you will find cutting-edge implementations of the most core machine learning (ML) algorithms and tools, like:

* __Regression__: Linear Regression (OLS), LASSO, Ridge Regression and Elastic Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regressor
* __Classification__: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Supervised Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes
* __Clustering__: K-Means, DBSCAN
* __Matrix Decomposition__: PCA, LU, QR, SVD, EVD
* __Distance Metrics__: Euclidian, Minkowski, Manhattan, Hamming, Mahalanobis
* __Evaluation Metrics__: Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R2

All of these algorithms are implemented in Rust. 

Why another machine learning library for Rust, you might ask? While there are at least three [general-purpose ML libraries](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/) for Rust,
most of these libraries either do not support all of the algorithms that are implemented in *SmartCore* or aren't integrated with [nalgebra](https://nalgebra.org/) and [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray).
All algorithms in *SmartCore* work well with both libraries. You can also use standard Rust vectors with all of the algorithms implemented here if you prefer to have minimum number of dependencies in your code.

We developed *SmartCore* to promote scientific computing in Rust. Our goal is to build an open-source library that has accurate, numerically stable, and well-documented implementations of the most well-known and widely used machine learning methods.

## Quick start

To start using *SmartCore* simply add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```yaml
[dependencies]
smartcore = "0.2.0"
```

You will also have to decide which linear algebra library to use with *SmartCore*. We support:
* [ndarray](https://docs.rs/ndarray) - provides an n-dimensional container for general elements and for numerics.
* [nalgebra](https://docs.rs/nalgebra/) - general-purpose linear algebra for computer graphics and computer physics.

If you prefer not to depend on any external library other than *SmartCore* you can use any algorithms implemented here with Rust [Vec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) and [array](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html). 

### Iris Flower Classification

Let's train our first machine learning algorithm using [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The Iris Dataset was introduced by the Ronald Fisher and is by far the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. This dataset is often used in classification and clustering examples. First let's fit [K-Nearest Neighbors]({{site.api_base_url}}/neighbors/index.html) algorithm to this dataset:

```rust
use smartcore::dataset::iris::load_dataset;
use smartcore::linalg::naive::dense_matrix::DenseMatrix;
use smartcore::neighbors::knn_classifier::KNNClassifier;
use smartcore::metrics::accuracy;
// Load Iris dataset
let iris_data = load_dataset();
// Turn Iris dataset into NxM matrix
let x = DenseMatrix::from_array(
    iris_data.num_samples,
    iris_data.num_features,
    &iris_data.data,
);
// These are our target class labels
let y = iris_data.target;
// Fit KNN classifier to Iris dataset
let knn = KNNClassifier::fit(
    &x,
    &y,        
    Default::default(),
).unwrap();
let y_hat = knn.predict(&x).unwrap(); // Predict class labels
// Calculate training error
println!("accuracy: {}", accuracy(&y, &y_hat)); // Prints 0.96
```

Now, if you want to fit [Logistic Regression]({{site.api_base_url}}/linear/logistic_regression/index.html) to your data you don't have to change your code a lot:

```rust
use smartcore::dataset::iris::load_dataset;
use smartcore::linalg::naive::dense_matrix::DenseMatrix;
use smartcore::linear::logistic_regression::LogisticRegression;
use smartcore::metrics::accuracy;
// Load Iris dataset
let iris_data = load_dataset();
// Turn Iris dataset into NxM matrix
let x = DenseMatrix::from_array(
    iris_data.num_samples,
    iris_data.num_features,
    &iris_data.data,
);
// These are our target class labels
let y = iris_data.target;
// Fit Logistic Regression to Iris dataset
let lr = LogisticRegression::fit(&x, &y, Default::default()).unwrap();
let y_hat = lr.predict(&x).unwrap(); // Predict class labels
// Calculate training error
println!("accuracy: {}", accuracy(&y, &y_hat)); // Prints 0.98
```

Our performance metric (accuracy) went up two percentage points! Nice work!

## High-level overview

Majority of machine learning algorithms rely on linear algebra routines and optimization methods to fit a model to a dataset or to make a prediction from new data. There are many crates for linear algebra and optimization in Rust but SmartCore does not have a hard dependency on any of these crates. Instead, machine learning algorithms in *SmartCore* use an abstraction layer where operations on multidimensional arrays and maximization/minimization routines are defined. This approach allows us to quickly integrate with any new type of matrix or vector as long as it implements all abstract methods from this layer. 

Functions from the optimization module are not available directly but we plan to make the optimization library public once it is mature enough. 

While functions from [linear algebra module]({{site.api_base_url}}/linalg/index.html) are public you should not use them directly because this module is still unstable. We keep this interface open to let anyone add implementations of other types of matrices that are currently not supported by *SmartCore*. Please see [Developer's Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/developer.html) if you want to add your favourite matrix type to *SmartCore*.

</figure>

Figure 1 shows 3 layers with abstract linear algebra and optimization functions at the first level, machine learning algorithms defined on top of the first level. Model evaluation and selection functions are at the top of the diagram since these functions are used to optimize and measure performance of statistical models.

### API

All algorithms in *SmartCore* implement the same interface when it comes to fitting an algorithm to your dataset or making a prediction from new data. All core interfaces are defined in the [api module]({{site.api_base_url}}/api/index.html).

There is a static function `fit` that fits an algorithm to your data. This function is defined in two places, [`SupervisedEstimator`]({{ site.api_base_url }}/api/trait.SupervisedEstimator.html) and [`UnsupervisedEstimator`]({{ site.api_base_url }}/api/trait.UnsupervisedEstimator.html), one is used for supervised learning and another for unsupervised learning. Both estimators take your training data and hyperparameters for the algorithm and produce a fully trained instance of the estimator. The only difference between these two traits is that `SupervisedEstimator` requires training target values in addition to training predictors to fit an algorithm to your data.

A function `predict` is defined in the [`Predictor`]({{ site.api_base_url }}/api/trait.Predictor.html) trait and is used to predict labels or target values from new data. All mandatory parameters of the model are declared as parameters of function `fit`. All optional parameters are hidden behind `Default::default()`.

### Input and Output

Algorithms in *SmartCore* take two dimensional arrays (matrices) and vectors as input and produce matrices and vectors on output, as demonstrated in Figure 2.

<figure class="image" align="center">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/io_format.svg" alt="Input and output format." class="img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Figure 2. Input and output as matrices and vectors where <em>N</em> is number of samples and <em>M</em> is number of features in each sample.</figcaption>
</figure>

**X** is a *NxM* matrix with your training data. Training data comes as a set of samples of length *N*. Each sample has *M* features. For supervised learning, you also provide a vector of training labels, **y** that should have length M. Traits [`BaseMatrix`]({{site.api_base_url}}/linalg/trait.BaseMatrix.html) and [`BaseVector`]({{site.api_base_url}}/linalg/trait.BaseVector.html) are where all matrix and vector operations used by *SmartCore* are defined. 

## Linear algebra libraries

All functions in *SmartCore* work well with ordinary Rust's vectors but we recommend using more advanced and faster crates for linear algebra, such as [ndarray](https://docs.rs/ndarray) and [nalgebra](https://docs.rs/nalgebra/). 

### ndarray

To enable `ndarray` add `ndarray-bindings` compilation feature to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```yaml
[dependencies]
smartcore = { version = "0.2.0", features=["ndarray-bindings"]}
```

To fit Logistic Regression to Iris dataset using `ndarray`:

```rust
use ndarray::Array;
use smartcore::dataset::iris::load_dataset;
use smartcore::linear::logistic_regression::LogisticRegression;
use smartcore::metrics::accuracy;
// Load Iris dataset
let iris_data = load_dataset();
// Turn Iris dataset into NxM matrix
let x = Array::from_shape_vec(
    (iris_data.num_samples, iris_data.num_features),
    iris_data.data,
).unwrap();
// These are our target class labels
let y = Array::from_shape_vec(iris_data.num_samples, iris_data.target).unwrap();
// Fit Logistic Regression to Iris dataset
let lr = LogisticRegression::fit(&x, &y, Default::default()).unwrap();
let y_hat = lr.predict(&x).unwrap(); // Predict class labels
// Calculate training error
println!("accuracy: {}", accuracy(&y, &y_hat)); // Prints 0.98
```

The only difference between this example and previous examples are lines where `x` and `y` variables are defined. 

### nalgebra

To enable nalgebra use `nalgebra-bindings` compilation feature:

```yaml
[dependencies]
smartcore = { version = "0.2.0", features=["nalgebra-bindings"]}
```

This is how you fit Logistic Regression to Iris dataset with `nalgebra`:

```rust
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, RowDVector};
use smartcore::dataset::iris::load_dataset;
use smartcore::linear::logistic_regression::LogisticRegression;
use smartcore::metrics::accuracy;
// Load Iris dataset
let iris_data = load_dataset();
// Turn Iris dataset into NxM matrix
let x = DMatrix::from_row_slice(
    iris_data.num_samples,
    iris_data.num_features,
    &iris_data.data,
);

// These are our target class labels
let y = RowDVector::from_iterator(iris_data.num_samples, iris_data.target.into_iter());

// Fit Logistic Regression to Iris dataset
let lr = LogisticRegression::fit(&x, &y, Default::default()).unwrap();
let y_hat = lr.predict(&x).unwrap(); // Predict class labels

// Calculate training error
println!("accuracy: {}", accuracy(&y, &y_hat)); // Prints 0.98
```
